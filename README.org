/swagg.el/ is an Emacs package that lets you fetch and interact with OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) definitions. You can think of it like a Swagger UI that your app has but works for multiple definitions and it's right inside your Emacs frame!

* Installation

swagg is available through [[https://melpa.org/#/swagg][MELPA]]. If you have it set up already, just do ~M-x package-install swagg~ and you are good to go. Otherwise please see [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][MELPA getting started]] page to learn how you can install packages through MELPA or see the following installation options.

Another way to install =swagg.el= would be using either [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight]] or [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][quelpa]] package managers:

#+begin_src elisp
;; Using straight:
(use-package swagg :straight (:host github :repo "isamert/swagg.el"))

;; Using quelpa:
(use-package swagg :quelpa (swagg :fetcher github :repo "isamert/swagg.el"))
#+end_src

* Basic usage

Set the variable ~swagg-definitions~. Here I added Swagger definitions for GitHub and GitLab. Notice that /swagg.el/ supports both ~json~ and ~yaml~ definitions. Definition files may be local files too.

#+begin_src elisp
(setq
 swagg-definitions
 '((:name "GitHub"
    :json "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/rest-api-description/main/descriptions/api.github.com/api.github.com.json"
    :base "https://api.github.com"
    :header-all ((token . "12345")
                 (Cache-Control . "no-cache")
                 (Content-Type . "application/json")
                 (Accept . "application/json")
                 (another-header . "value")))
   (:name "GitLab"
    :yaml "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/raw/master/doc/api/openapi/openapi.yaml"
    :base "https://gitlab.com/api"
    :header ((token . "12345")
             (Cache-Control . "no-cache")
             (Content-Type . "application/json")
             (Accept . "application/json")
             (another-header . "value")))))
#+end_src

That's it. Now you can use the following functions:

- ~swagg-request~ :: Lets you interactively select an endpoint, using ~completing-read~ and then asks interactively for all required query strings, query parameters etc. and makes the request. Result of the request is shown in a separate special buffer. Only response body is shown. If you want to display headers, call ~swagg-display-headers~ in the response buffer.
- ~swagg-request-with-rest-block~ :: Same as above, but instead of making the request, insert rest style request string that you can use with [[https://github.com/federicotdn/verb][verb]], [[https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el][restclient]], [[https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-http][ob-http]] etc. Now you can utilize one of these packages to send your request.
- ~swagg-request-with-fetch~ :: Same as above, but instead of inserting rest style requests, insert a JS fetch() call.

Note that /swagg.el/ caches the definitions on the first fetch. If your definition changes, you may need to call ~swagg-invalidate-cache~ function.

* Customization

Please do ~M-x customize-group swagg RET~ to see all customization options. Most of them are pretty self-explanatory. Here, I will go over some more obscure customizations:

** Binding variables & including variables to requests

Each time you call one of the interactive functions and select and endpoint to work on, you'll be prompted for each variable that endpoint requires. Entering some of these variables, like authentication headers, can become repetitive. For this, you can pre-bind these variables while setting the definitions using ~:header~, ~:query~ and ~:any~ options. You can also include headers and query parameters to every request by utilizing ~:header-all~ and ~:query-all~ options:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq
 swagg-definitions
 '((:name "GitHub API"
    :json "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/rest-api-description/main/descriptions/api.github.com/api.github.com.json"
    :base "https://api.github.com"

    ;; Default query parameters
    :query ((per_page . "100")
            (sort . "created"))

    ;; Query parameters to be included in every request
    :query-all ((access_token . "your-access-token"))

    ;; Default headers
    :header ((User-Agent . "my-app-client"))

    ;; Headers to be included in every request
    :header-all ((Content-Type . "application/json")
                 (Authorization . "Bearer your-auth-token"))

    ;; Default values for any type of parameter
    :any ((locale . "en-US")
          (cache_control . "no-cache")))))
#+end_src

When you bind parameters like this, they will appear as the default string while constructing the request. If you want them to be never asked and automatically accepted as given parameters, set ~swagg-auto-accept-bound-values~ to a non nil value.

As a side note, swagg automatically remembers the values you entered for the session, see ~swagg-remember-inputs~.
